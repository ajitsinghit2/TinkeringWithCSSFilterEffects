Tinkering With CSS Filter Effects
=============

A simple playground for CSS Filter Effects.

[CSS Filter Effects](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/filters/index.html)  are an experimental part of CSS that aims to bring basic, Instagram or Photoshop-like filters to CSS.

CSS Filter Effects, are not, however, restricted to images. You can apply them to nearly any DOM element.

This example only uses the filter effects functions. It does not allow you to change the `filter-margin-top`, `filter-margin-bottom` `filter-margin-left`, `filter-margin-right` or `filter-margin` properties. Nor does it allow you to use SVG filters or [CSS Shaders](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/css-shaders.html) (custom filters).

One final thing to keep in mind: [CSS Filter Effects](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/filters/index.html) are an experimental part of CSS, with [limited browser support](caniuse.com/#search=css filter). They're not quite ready for prime time.
